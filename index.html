<p id="main-section">
    The main section of this page serves as the central hub for demonstrating various CSS selectors and their practical applications. It introduces the concept of selectors, which are patterns used to select the elements you want to style in your HTML document. By understanding how selectors work, developers can efficiently target specific elements, groups of elements, or elements based on their attributes, classes, or IDs. This foundational knowledge is essential for creating visually appealing and well-structured web pages, as it allows for precise control over the presentation and layout of content. The main section also provides context for the examples shown, guiding users through the different types of selectors and their use cases.

<p id="section">
    The section element in this example highlights the use of class selectors and demonstrates how content can be organized within a web page. Sections are commonly used to group related content together, making it easier to apply styles and manage the structure of a document. In this case, the section contains a heading, an introductory paragraph, and a list of items, some of which share a common class for styling purposes. By leveraging sectioning elements and class selectors, developers can create modular and maintainable code, ensuring that styles are applied consistently across similar elements. This approach enhances readability and accessibility, making the web page more user-friendly.

<p id="article">
    The article element showcases how semantic HTML can be combined with CSS selectors to create distinct areas of content within a web page. Articles are typically used for self-contained pieces of information, such as blog posts, news stories, or documentation. In this example, the article includes a title, a paragraph, and a blockquote, illustrating how different types of content can be styled and presented. Using element selectors, attribute selectors, and descendant selectors, developers can target specific parts of the article for unique styling, improving the visual hierarchy and user experience. Semantic markup not only aids in styling but also enhances search engine optimization and accessibility for all users.
